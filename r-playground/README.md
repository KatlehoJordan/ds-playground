# `r` playground for data science

This container is meant to be used for rapid development of data science projects using `r`.

## Getting started

1. Open a new VS Code workspace in `r-playground`
2. Use VS Code Dev containers to build a base container
3. From a terminal, run `bash .devcontainer/install-vs-code-extensions.sh` to install the VS Code Extensions.

- If any extensions indicate that a reload is required, reload.

4. Make sure you can run `radian` by sending `r` to the terminal
5. Open `r-in-vs-code.r` and follow instructions to ensure the features are working as expected.

## Backlog

- Provide example using r unit testing
- Provide instructions for setting up r package
- Ensure all linting is working
