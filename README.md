# Python for ds container

This container is meant to be used for rapid development of data science projects.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Use VS Code Dev containers to build a base container
4. From a terminal, use `sudo python main.py` to verify you have root user access and that `python` is working
5. From a terminal, use `ipython` to verify `ipython` is installed
6. Open `demo.ipynb` and run the cells to ensure that `jupyter` notebook is setup and renders `plotly` graphs

## Next steps
