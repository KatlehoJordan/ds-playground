# Data Science Playground

This repository is meant to provide quick ways to get started in reproducible data-science docker containers for:

- `python`
- `r`

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Open a new VS Code session in `python` or `r` depending on which language you would like to use.
4. Follow the `README.md` instructions in the respective folder.

## Strengths and Weakness of the languages

**Strengths for `python`:**

- More users, so:
  - More extensions with easier setup
  - More tutorials and useful hints from GitHub Copilot
- Fewer dependencies to get it running for use in Jupyter

**Strengths for `r`:**

- The piping syntax from `tidyverse` can make data analysis very fast
- The documentation is more standardized and easier to retrieve (just `?<function name>`)
