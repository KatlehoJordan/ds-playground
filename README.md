# Data Science Playground

This repository is meant to provide quick ways to get started in reproducible data-science docker containers for:

- `python`
- `r`

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Decide if you would like to use a `python` or an `r` container then follow the `README.md` instructions in the respective `<language>-playground` folder.

## Ongoing work

1. Split python and r into own docker images, because putting them into one becomes way too large
   1. Starting with `r`

## Backlog

- publish the finished image on GitHub for easier retrieval and faster building
