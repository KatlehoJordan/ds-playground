This may mean it is the preferred method going forward since it handles the path string not as a string, but as a `Path` object with its own expected behavior and associated methods.\n",

    "Furthermore, at least one (source)[https://www.learndatasci.com/solutions/python-check-if-files-exist/] indicates using the `pathlib` method may be more robust to failures do to 'races', where the program is performing different activities asynchronously, however the code and rationale provided do not immediately convince me."
