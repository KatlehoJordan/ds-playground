They could have been iterating over characters, for example, but that is not the observed behavior. Note that iterators do not typically get 'reset'. That is, once you increment, you cannot decrement but you must rather create a new iterator if you want to start the cycle over. That is why I can, below, iterate a couple of times manually with `__next__`, but then finish iterating with a `for` loop."
